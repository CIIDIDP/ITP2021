# ITP2021

Welcome to the class Introduction to Programming (ITP). In this class we will be dealing with programming languages, programming environments, algorithms, and processes.

## Course Description

### **A Brief Introduction to Programming**

In recent years programming has not only become an everyday tool for interaction designers but also a material in itself.

On the one hand we have seen tools emerge that made it really easy for designers and artists to engage with programming and scripting ( e.g. P5.js, Processing.org, Arduino.cc but also Adobe Illustrator, Rhino3D and IFTTT etc. ). On the other hand, our aesthetic *expectations* have been heavily influenced by generative and process-informed design.

Although in the community it is still discussed to what degree or even if at all interaction designers need to know how to program, we strongly believe that the benefits of knowing how to program outweigh the difficulties of learning how to program by far.

The very least one can learn when engaging with programming is *an appreciation for the medium*. This means e.g to acquire some of the vocabulary required to communicate with avid programmers, get a better understanding of what is technically feasible, and gain a basic understanding of the digital aesthetics. When becoming more adept in programming one will be able to *Sketch with Code*, *Build Prototypes* and realize entire projects. This skill set should not be underestimated. There is a big difference between telling somebody what to build and building something oneself. Iteration cycles can be kept tight, vague notions can be explored, indescribable ideas can be shaped, digital tools can be crafted. On a different tangent the avid programming interaction designer will be able to inquire the full aesthetic potential of new and digital media through practice.

Learning how to programming is not always a liniear *success story*. It requires patience and *resilience to frustration*; somewhat similar to learning how to play a musical instrument. But similarily to the musical instrument it can be quite rewarding, enjoyable, and transformative at times. Let s start the journey.

### **Class Structure**

The ITP class will be split into two parts: *Week 01* and *Week 02*.

In *Week 01* we will be starting with the very basics of programming, gradually working our selves towards more complex and capable concepts of programming.

In *Week 02* you, the students, will be asked to develop your own projects revolving around the theme of *nature*.

### **Teaching Concept + Modus Operandi**

The goal of *Week 01* is to get everybody up to a level on which they feel comfortable to take on a self-assigned project.

The days are mainly composed of a series of small programming topics which we call *blocks* that will first be introduced by example by the teachers in a live programming session, and then reiterated by the students in small exercises. At the end of each day we allocate some time to either give those of you who are still struggling with the topics of the day to revisit and talk about the learnings of the day, or to offer some extra bits of knowledge for those of you who felt under-challenged during the day in a format that we call *microexcursions*.

The *Teaching Concept* of *Week 01* is that you will be exposed to a lot of small concepts in small heaps. It is a mixture of passive listening and watching the concepts introduced and an active experimenting with the previously learned. We encourage you to revisit the topics of the day after class ( e.g by watching online-tutorial videos or tinker with the sketches ).

In *Week 02* we shift the modus and will start the week with *The Brief* ( announced in the end of *Week 01* ) in which we will ask you to develop and realize your own one-week projects. The week will be structured into session of discussions about your ideas and progress, sessions of focused work on your projects, as well as ad-hoc *microexcursions* on peripheral topics. The class will end with a final presentation of your works.

The *Teaching Concept* of *Week 02* is that you, the students, work on your projects and we, the teachers, help you to solve design/programming problems and encourage you to refine your concepts ( while working on them ). A constant negotiation and re-iteration between the desired and the feasible.

This also implies that we need you to stay very focused and invest as much time and energy as possible. The general rule of thumb here is: the more you invest the more you will get back, and consequently, the more you will learn and grow.

We will also ask you to be patient with yourselves. As mentioned earlier developing or improving your design-programming skills is not always an easy endeavor. Friction, failure and frustration are very common and reoccurring experiences in a design-programming-based project. But do not worry we will encourage and assist you to become more resilient to or even overcome such states.
